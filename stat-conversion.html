    <h1>Convert Modern EVs to RGBY Format</h1>
    <p>102 EVs will result in a maxed stat (65535 points). Special Attack and Special Defence get combined into Special. If there are additional EVs over 102, they are randomly distributed among the other stats. If you have 102 EVs in every stat (except for a total of 102 among Special Attack and Special Defence), your Pok√©mon will start out with the maximum 510 EVs and every stat will be maxed in RGBY format.<p>
